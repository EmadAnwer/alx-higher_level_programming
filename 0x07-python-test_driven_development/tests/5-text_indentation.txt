---------------------

This is a text_indentation test file.
First import ``text_indentation`` from the ``5-text_indentation.py`` module:

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

Input not string:
    >>> text_indentation(123)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: text must be a string

Empty input:
    >>> text_indentation('')
    
Text without periods, question marks, and colons:
    >>> text_indentation('This text without periods - question marks - colons')
    This text without periods - question marks - colons

Text with periods, question marks, and colons:
    >>> text_indentation('This is a sentence. This is another sentence? And here is a sentence with a colon:')
    This is a sentence.
    <BLANKLINE>
    This is another sentence?
    <BLANKLINE>
    And here is a sentence with a colon:
    <BLANKLINE>

Text with leading/trailing spaces:
    >>> text_indentation('  Leading and trailing spaces.  ')
    Leading and trailing spaces.
    <BLANKLINE>

Text with multiple lines:
    >>> text_indentation('This is line 1.This is line 2?And this is line 3:')
    This is line 1.
    <BLANKLINE>
    This is line 2?
    <BLANKLINE>
    And this is line 3:
